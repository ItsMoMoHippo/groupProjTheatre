### Intro
 - Welcome to the repository off the Box Office group 7, if you have any issues, please file an issue
 - If you are a part of the group, and want to help develop please:
  - fork the repo 
  - `git clone` your version
  - switch to your own feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
  - commit your changes, and push to your branch on the main repo
  - create a pull request(PR)
 - after the code will be reviewed and added if there is no issues
  - if there are issues, you can make more changes and push again to the branch

### Current Progress
 So far with the limited knowledge we have, is simply set up foundations on what we will implement for the project
